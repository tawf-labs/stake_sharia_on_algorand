# Tawf Sharia

**Halal Staking for a Trustworthy DeFi Future on Algorand**

> The first Sharia-audited staking protocol empowering Muslim investors to participate in DeFi safely, ethically, and transparently—now on Algorand using `tawf_sharia`.

---

## 🌊 Deployment

🟢 **Tawf Sharia is deployed on the Algorand blockchain**, chosen for its **security, scalability, and low-fee architecture**.  
All staking logic, auditing, and verification are handled **natively via Algorand smart contracts** and the `tawf_sharia` client.

---

## 🧩 Problem It Solves

Tawf Sharia addresses the long-standing challenge of **trust and accessibility in DeFi for Muslim investors**.  
Despite the **$3 trillion Islamic finance market**, no existing staking protocol offers **verifiable on-chain Sharia compliance**.

This gap has caused:

- **Regulatory and religious uncertainty**, particularly in Indonesia and other Muslim-majority nations.  
  _“Crypto market is legal, but not halal yet.”_
- **Financial exclusion** of a massive potential user base due to lack of trust.

**Tawf Sharia** introduces a **Sharia-certified staking model** using the *Ijarah (rental) contract*, allowing users to:

- Participate in DeFi **ethically and safely**.  
- Earn **stable and halal returns** through a transparent and auditable mechanism.  
- Build **confidence in blockchain** without compromising religious principles.

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

Building a Sharia-compliant DeFi protocol on Algorand involved **technical and philosophical challenges**.

### Key Hurdles

- **Modeling the Ijarah contract on-chain** – Translating rental-based profit-sharing logic into Algorand smart contracts required custom structures for Ujrah (rental fees) and validation rights.
- **Balancing decentralization with compliance** – Contracts had to allow external Sharia audits without breaking trustlessness.
- **Designing transparent on-chain audit verification** – Ensuring audit data is readable, verifiable, and stored securely on Algorand.

### How We Overcame Them

- Consulted **Islamic finance experts** and referenced **MUI Fatwa No.7/2021**.
- Built a **modular architecture** (Python + AlgoKit + React) separating staking logic, audits, and reporting.
- Leveraged **Algorand smart contract accounts and boxes** to ensure secure, auditable transaction flows.
